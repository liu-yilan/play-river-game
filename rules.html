            the rules are simple! to preface, you always play the white stones; the computer always plays the black stones.
            <br>
            <br>
            players may freely move their stones up and down their respective columns. the only two restrictions are as follows:
            <br>
            <br>
            (1) on both players' first moves, they may not "cross the river". that is to say, on black's first move, they may not move their selected stone across the river; on white's first move, they may not move their selected stone 
            across the river. 
            <br>
            <br>
            (2) stones may not hop over each other.
            <br>
            <br>
            that's it! this is a game of "don't die first": it is game over if you have no more moves to make. hypothetically, a game could last
            forever if players are evenly matched. see if you can beat the computer :)
